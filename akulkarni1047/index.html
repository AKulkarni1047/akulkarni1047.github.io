                <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I grew up on the Internet, discovering platforms like YouTube and Orkut at a young age. Fascinated by what made these possible, I knew I wanted to be part of the teams building the tools that connect the world.</p>
<br>
<p>As an Information Science Engineering student at Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering (DSCE), India, I learned software development fundamentals alongside core computer science subjects like Operating Systems, Computer Networks, and Data Structures. I also applied these skills to develop software across various tech stacks and industries, making an impact through public-benefit projects. After DSCE, I joined Light & Wonder, a leading cross-platform gaming company. I worked on multiple projects solving key industry challenges, which helped me realize the importance of creating efficient, innovative, and user-centric software solutions.</p>
<br>
<p>Now pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Information Systems Management at Carnegie Mellon University, I am eager to contribute to companies focused on user-centric solutions. I am seeking internships for Summer 2025 in Software Development, Software Engineering, DevOps, and Product Management. Please reach out to me via email or call to discuss my potential with your organization.</p>
